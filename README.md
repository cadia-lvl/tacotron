# Setup
* Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Download and extract the dataset to be used into the `dataset` folder
* Before training, the data has to be preprocessed. Run `preprocess.py --<dataset>` for that
* Now you can start training

# Other notes
* If you run into filewatcher issues, blacklist datasets, virtualenv and `.git`
